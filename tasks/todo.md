# Phase 1 engine facade — task list

- [x] Implement `core/src/engine.rs`: Engine, LiveOrder map, place/cancel/move sagas, EngineOutcome/EngineError
- [x] Wire into `lib.rs`
- [x] Unit tests: every saga path (see plan §Tests)
- [x] Property: engine-level conservation + lock sufficiency, widened strategy — **fixed 2026-09-14: `live_ids` was never populated, so cancel/move arms were silent no-ops; now genuinely exercised**
- [x] Gates: build + fmt + clippy -D warnings + all tests (86/86, debug + release)
- [x] Record: decision rows (engine facade, floor settlement, market reserve), weekly log, TODO Phase 1 pointer
- [ ] Commit
